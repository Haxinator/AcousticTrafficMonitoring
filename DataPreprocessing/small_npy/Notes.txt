Training better than before with new data. About 50%

The data is still bad.
1. Car and background now somewhat distinguishable. Car "sounds" may be too quiet there is no car noise. -> Tighten segment, e.g. only keep the loud car passing sound.
2. Car and cv indistinguishable. Absolutely no improvement to accuracy. -> car and cv likely sound the same. -> Likely the build up and going away sound exactly the same.
3. cv and background can be distinguished (decent accuracy 68%).

Fix:
1 and 2: Tighten cv and car sounds. Keep only the loud passing sound.
Car and cv -> some cars sound like cvs. Maybe when the noise is faint they're indistinguishable.

Model:
convolutional layer -> not necessary (no information gained from clustered events, used for speech or images).
recorrent layer -> not necessary (used for natural language and time-series, has a memory, have snn so pointless).
Transformer -> not needed (encoding and decoding mostly used for NLP).
