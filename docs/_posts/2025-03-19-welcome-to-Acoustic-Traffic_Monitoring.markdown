This blog post serves as a record for our Software Design Project undertaken at the University
of Western Australia.

Our project is to create an Acoustic Traffic Monitoring System using the Xylo Development Kit v3.0.
The benefit of using this kit is it's built in microphone, SNN model support and low power consumption.
This allowed us to focus on software development and creating an SNN to recognise cars without the added
layer of complexity of designing and choosing hardware.

Xylo can be used with Rockpool: a specialised Python library for developing, training and deploying an SNN. Rockpool and its extensive documentation made development faster and easier.

The source code used in the development of this project can be found in the following [Github Respository][repo].
